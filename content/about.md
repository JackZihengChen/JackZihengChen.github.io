### MS student in Computer Engineering 
I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master’s in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am affiliated with the [DEPEND Research Group](https://depend.csl.illinois.edu/#sthash.WWK3VtO9.dpbs) at UIUC and actively engaged in research. My academic interests include autonomous vehicles, machine learning, cloud computing, and computer vision.

I enjoy exploring new things, whether trying different restaurants or using technology. I’m good at spotting problems and trying to make them better. I also enjoy taking apart and putting together electronic devices like keyboards, computers, and car radios.

I listen to [podcasts about staying healthy](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) and discovering new music when driving. It’s all about having fun and learning new things!


### Seeking an internship in software engineering for Summer 2024
I am authorized to work in the US and do not require sponsorship.
