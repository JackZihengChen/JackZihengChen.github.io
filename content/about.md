### MS student seeking an internship in software engineering for Summer 2024

I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am affiliated with the [DEPEND Research Group](https://depend.csl.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and actively engaged in research. 

I like trying out new things, from restaurants to technology.  I have a passion for disassembling and reassembling various electronic devices and gadgets, including car head units, personal computers, laptops, smartphones, keyboards, and mice. I can put them back together most of the time. When driving, I enjoy listening to podcasts that focus on health-related topics and exploring novel music selections.




### Academic Interests
autonomous vehicles, machine learning, cloud computing, and computer vision.
