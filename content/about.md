I'm Jack (陈自衡), a [Master's student](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/grad-students/zihengc2) in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), set to graduate in May 2025.

I have interned at [StoneX Group](https://www.stonex.com/) and [Ecolab](https://www.ecolab.com/), where I excelled in roles that required me to innovate and streamline system efficiencies through quick prototyping. 

My research within the [DEPEND Research Group](https://depend.csl.illinois.edu/) has been a cornerstone of my academic pursuit. Here, I focus on using machine learning to enhance system reliability.
