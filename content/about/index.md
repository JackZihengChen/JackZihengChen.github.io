### MS student seeking an internship in software engineering for Summer 2024

I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am affiliated with the [DEPEND Research Group](https://depend.csl.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and actively engaged in research. My academic interests includes *autonomous vehicles*, *machine learning*, *cloud computing*, and *computer vision*.

I enjoy exploring new things, whether it's trying out different restaurants or tinkering with technology. I'm really good at spotting problems and trying to make them better. I also have fun taking apart and putting together electronic devices like keyboards, computers, and car radios.

When I'm driving, I like to listen to podcasts about staying healthy and discovering new music. It's all about having fun and learning new things!
