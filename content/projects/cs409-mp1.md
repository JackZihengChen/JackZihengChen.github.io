#### Project Overview
In this web development project, I crafted a comprehensive single-page website using HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The project allowed me to delve into the world of front-end development, gaining practical experience with key technologies like HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and Javascript (ES5 or ES6).

Here are the notable features integrated into my single-page website:

1. **Layout and Structure:** I organized content into full-width horizontal sections, creating a cohesive webpage for a company/organization, product, or personal/portfolio page.
2. **Sticky Navbar:** Implemented a top navigation bar that remains fixed at the top of the window while scrolling for easy navigation.
3. **Position Indicator:** Added a visual indicator in the navigation bar, highlighting the current reading position. The last menu item is dynamically highlighted when scrolling to the page's bottom.
4. **Navbar Resizing:** The navigation bar dynamically adjusts its size, becoming larger when users are at the top of the page and resizing to a smaller version as users scroll down. Font sizes also adapt accordingly.
5. **Smooth Scrolling:** Incorporated smooth scrolling functionality when navigating to different sections using the navigation bar.
6. **Carousel/Slider:** Designed a carousel/slider with a minimum of three slides, complete with navigation arrows for seamless exploration.
7. **Multi-column Layout:** Created a section with a multi-column layout for varied content presentation.
8. **Centering:** Ensured horizontal centering for content in each section and maintained vertical centering for at least one element, accommodating changes in outer element dimensions.
9. **Responsiveness:** Verified that the webpage maintains a visually appealing appearance across various resolutions, including 1920x1080, 1366x768, 1280x720, and 1024x768.
10. **Background Image:** Incorporated a fixed-position background image in one of the sections for enhanced visual appeal.
11. **Modal Windows:** Integrated modal windows within sections to display additional content, enhancing user engagement.
12. **Video Embedding:** Utilized the HTML5 video tag to seamlessly embed a video into the webpage.
13. **CSS3 Animations:** Included at least one CSS3 animation, such as fade in/out or transitions, for enhanced visual dynamics.
14. **Scalable Vector Icons:** Incorporated scalable vector icons through CSS, leveraging FontAwesome for a modern and flexible design.
15. **Social Media Icons:** Included recognizable social media icons, contributing to a well-rounded and connected web presence.
