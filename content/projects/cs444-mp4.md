- Developed a dedicated debugging notebook, "GAN_debugging.ipynb," featuring a smaller network trained on the MNIST dataset for validation and testing.
- Demonstrated attention to detail by verifying loss functions and training code on the smaller dataset before transitioning to the main project
- Completed the debugging GAN training on MNIST in approximately five minutes and the main project GAN training on the cat dataset in about one hour

#### Project Overview
As part of this project, I am working on training a generative adversarial network (GAN) using a dataset of cat images. The main goal is to create realistic cat face images through the process of training.

This project provides me with a hands-on opportunity to explore generative models and recurrent neural networks. I will be using PyTorch to implement GANs and will learn techniques to enhance the quality of the generated images. The inspiration for this project comes from various sources, including Stanford CS231n Assignments, CMU 16-726 Assignment 3, and PyTorch Tutorials.

To guide the implementation, I will be using a top-level notebook called "MP4.ipynb." This notebook outlines the steps to implement and train two different models: the original GAN and LSGAN, which uses a different loss function. The architecture of the generator and discriminator networks is loosely based on DCGAN. Additionally, I will be incorporating data augmentation using PyTorch's built-in transforms.

For debugging purposes, there is a separate notebook named "GAN_debugging.ipynb." This notebook features a smaller network that I can use to train on the MNIST dataset. It is recommended to start with the MNIST portion to ensure that the loss functions and training code are correct before moving on to the main part of the project. Training the debugging GAN on MNIST takes around five minutes, while training the main GAN on the cat dataset takes approximately one hour.
