#### Project Overview
##### Introduction
In our final project, we utilized data from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) to create a graph representation of airports and their routes. Our project incorporates three key algorithms: Djikstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two airports, a Landmark Path algorithm for determining the shortest path between two airports with landmarks in between, and a Page Rank algorithm to identify important airports.

##### Code and Data Overview
The project codebase comprises several files, each serving a specific purpose:
* **Airport:** Defines the vertices of our graph structure, with details such as name, ID, city, country, and geographical coordinates.
* **Flight:** Constructs edges (flights) between airports, where the weight of an edge represents the distance between two airports.
* **airport_graph:** The graph class supporting the creation and insertion of vertices and edges.
* **BFS:** Implements Breadth-First Search for graph traversal.
* **Djikstras:** Implements Djikstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
* **Landmark:** Implements the Landmark Path algorithm.
* **PageRank:** Implements the Page Rank algorithm.
* **main:** Contains tests for the algorithms.

##### Running the Program
To execute the program, use the 'finalproject' executable and follow these steps:
1. Compile with `make all`.
2. Run the program with `./finalproject`.
3. Choose the dataset to construct the graph.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to perform various operations, such as BFS traversal, shortest path calculations, PageRank, and Landmark Path. Some operations may require custom inputs.

To end the program, use `Ctrl+C`.

##### Main Function Overview
The main function comprises seven cases, allowing users to interact with different aspects of our project. Users can observe results from BFS traversal, PageRank algorithm, Landmark Path algorithm, and Djikstra's algorithm.

##### Testing
Tests can be executed with:
```
make test
./test
```
Our tests cover the functionality of constructing airports, building graphs, implementing PageRank, BFS traversal, Djikstra's algorithm, and the Landmark Path algorithm.
