#### Problem Statement
In complex and dynamic real-world situations involving multiple actors, ensuring safety is a significant challenge. This complexity often leads to severe accidents. The current techniques for mitigating safety hazards are not effective because they do not guarantee accessible escape routes and do not specifically address actors contributing to hazards. As a result, these techniques may not provide timely responses. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new measure called the safety-threat indicator (STI). This metric helps identify crucial actors by incorporating defensive driving techniques through counterfactual reasoning. We utilize STI to analyze real-world datasets, revealing inherent biases towards safe scenarios. Additionally, we employ it to develop a hazard mitigation policy using reinforcement learning. 

Our approach demonstrates a substantial reduction in the accident rate for advanced autonomous vehicle agents in rare hazardous scenariosâ€”up to a 77% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. 


#### Contributions
- Proposed an innovative traffic risk assessment method to enhance the dependability of AVs in unfamiliar scenarios
- Verified the method using 30,000+ simulated trials in the `CARLA Simulator` and the `Argoverse` real-world dataset
- Boosted testing efficiency by 200% using `subprocess` in python, optimizing the simulation data generation pipeline
- Constructed 6,000 unfamiliar scenarios from `NHTSA` pre-crash typologies and trained Reinforcement Learning Agents in `PyTorch` to preemptively brake using the traffic risk as an indicator, reducing accidents by 72.7%
