#### Contributions
- Utilized `alphashape` in `Python` to calculate the reachable area of a vehicle following a bicycle model to identify risky vehicles in traffic and introduced methods to improve safety in an end-to-end AV simulation
- Executed simulations in parallel with `subprocess` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` in `Python` to generate over 20,000 traces from adverse seed scenarios with varied parameters, e.g., cut-in speed and timing of safety-critical actors
- Cleansed and statistically analyzed generated datasets using `pandas`, and visualized outcomes with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`, proving efficacy of the proposed metric over current state-of-the-art risk assignment methods
- Implemented a Reinforcement Learning Agent in `PyTorch` that uses ego-vehicle telemetry and images from three front-facing cameras in the perception module to achieve a 50% reduction in accidents through emergency braking

#### Problem Statement
In complex and dynamic real-world situations involving multiple actors, ensuring safety is a significant challenge. This complexity often leads to severe accidents. The current techniques for mitigating safety hazards are not effective because they do not guarantee accessible escape routes and do not specifically address actors contributing to hazards. As a result, these techniques may not provide timely responses. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new measure called the safety-threat indicator (STI). This metric helps identify crucial actors by incorporating defensive driving techniques through counterfactual reasoning. We utilize STI to analyze real-world datasets, revealing inherent biases towards safe scenarios. Additionally, we employ it to develop a hazard mitigation policy using reinforcement learning. 

Our approach demonstrates a substantial reduction in the accident rate for advanced autonomous vehicle agents in rare hazardous scenariosâ€”up to a 77% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.
