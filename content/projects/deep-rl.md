- Implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and its successor Double DQN for playing Atari Breakout using OpenAI - Gym
- Developed a recurrent state mechanism to encode and maintain a history of actions and observations
- Managed hyperparameters through "config.py" to achieve a mean score of 10 within computational limitations (around 2000 episodes)
- Monitored and debugged progress using expected rewards versus the number of episodes as a benchmark
- Demonstrated problem-solving and experimentation skills within the constraints outlined in the assignment
- Successfully contributed to achieving the target evaluation score of 10 for either "agent.py" or - "agent_double.py"
