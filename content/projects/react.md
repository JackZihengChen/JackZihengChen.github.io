- Developed a responsive single-page React application as a part of a project to interface with external APIs
- Implemented key features, including a dynamic list view with query-based filtering and sorting options, a gallery view for visual content exploration, and a detailed view for selected items with navigation buttons
- Successfully handled potential `API` interaction challenges, such as unavailability and rate-limiting, by incorporating data mocking strategies and caching solutions
- Utilized `React Router` for effective navigation and route handling within the application
- Employed `Axios` for efficient API calls, ensuring seamless data retrieval and interaction
- Ensured a user-friendly experience by implementing strategic error handling within the application.
- Provided type checking for code reliability using `TypeScript`
- Demonstrated the project's outcome through an example, aligning with outlined requirements and serving as a reference for the envisioned user interface and functionality
