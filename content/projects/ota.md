#### Problem Statement
In the rapidly advancing field of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems is paramount. Traditional AV datasets provide a wealth of scenarios for training and testing AV systems under normal conditions, but they fall short when it comes to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenariosâ€”situations that the vehicle might never have encountered during training but could potentially face on the road.

This project introduces a robust OOD Data Generation Pipeline specifically designed for CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. Our pipeline focuses on systematically generating and modifying safety-critical scenarios provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to include OOD conditions. This allows us to explore the limits of AV systems in a controlled yet challenging environment.


#### Contributions
- Created 6 safety-critical scenarios following 80% of crash typologies from NHTSA
