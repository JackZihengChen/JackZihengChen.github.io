#### Project Overview
I embarked on a two-part project to gain hands-on experience with PyTorch and explore the application of pre-trained deep learning models in practical scenarios. Let me break down the project from my perspective:

**Part 1: Self-supervised Learning on CIFAR10**

In this phase, my goal was to train a model using PyTorch for a self-supervised task on the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of small images (32x32 pixels) categorized into 10 object classes. For the self-supervised training, I ignored the provided class labels and focused on a task involving the random rotation of images by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. The model's objective was to classify the rotation angle of each input image using cross-entropy loss.

Here's an overview of the steps and objectives:

1. **Rotation Prediction Task:**
   - Trained a pre-implemented ResNet18 on the rotation prediction task.
   - Generated rotated images and labels.
   - Reported the test performance, aiming for an expected accuracy of around 78%.

2. **Fine-tuning:**
   - Fine-tuned only the weights of the final block of convolutional layers and the linear layer on the supervised CIFAR10 classification task.
   - Compared the performance between initializing from the rotation model and random weights, targeting a test set accuracy of around 60%.

3. **Full Training:**
   - Trained the entire network on the supervised CIFAR10 classification task.
   - Compared the performance between initializing from the rotation model and random weights, aiming for an expected accuracy of around 80%.

4. **Extra Credit:**
   - Attempted to replicate a plot from a research paper demonstrating the advantages of pre-training on the Rotation task with limited labeled data.
   - Explored more advanced models and experimented with training a rotation prediction model on the larger ImageNette dataset.

**Part 2: YOLO Object Detection on PASCAL VOC**

For the second part, I focused on implementing a YOLO-like object detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Here are the main steps and considerations:

1. **Network Implementation:**
   - Utilized a provided pre-trained network structure inspired by DetNet.
   - Implemented the loss function of YOLO in the "yolo_loss.py" file.

2. **Object Detection:**
   - Aimed to produce results similar to those shown in an example image.

While the network structure could be replaced by a different architecture and trained from scratch, the project recommendation was to stick with the provided one for optimal accuracy with less computational expense.
